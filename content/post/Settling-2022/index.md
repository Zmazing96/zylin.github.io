## Summary

This industrial project is aimed to identify the ideal discharge time of the urban settling tank which has been receiving stormwater runoff during rainy season.

The outcome is essential as it prevents the spike of pollutants while discharging to the nearby waterbody. The volume of this tank is 11,500 m3 and made of reinforced concrete.

- This work has been published in a peer-reviewed article after proper reporting to the local authority.
