abstract: The integration of multiple resources conservation networks is necessary to attain the ever-stringent sustainable goals. This work takes initiatives to develop a heat integrated water network via a proposed P-graph-based sequential methodology. In the first step, a set of feasible water regeneration networks is generated using the conventional P-graph framework. Then, the obtained feasible networks will be used as the inputs in the second stage which aims to generate various sets of feasible heat exchanger networks. It is worth noting that the second model is solved by an extended P-graph framework (P-HENS) for combinatorial process network optimization. The solutions are then ranked based on the total network cost. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a typical water regeneration network (three sources and three sinks) with multi-contaminants is used. The results show a total of 103 feasible water network structures (water network cost ranging from 0.76 M$/y to 1.18 M$/y). Thereafter, a list of feasible HIWRN can be determined using P-HENS. The top four HIWRNs which offer similar total network cost (~1.639 M$/y) are demonstrated. This proposed method provides valuable insights that allow decision-makers to further select the optimal solution which may be more beneficial as compared to the one obtained via conventional methods.
