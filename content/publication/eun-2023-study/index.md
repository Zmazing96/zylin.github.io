abstract: This study aims to identify the cause of the red-water occurrence (the phenomenon of water being red) that occurs at some points and sections of rivers in Yongin City. As a result of conducting a preliminary investigation, total three sites were selected as the investigation point as it was found that the red-water occurrence continued. As a result of the investigation, it is judged that the cause of the red-water in Yongin-city river is due to the soil color and iron content of the region. JPS, SBS, and JJS sites all showed that the color of soil is mainly consist of reddish brown and red-yellow. The average Fe concentration was 13.75 mg/L, 10.85 mg/L, and 1.31 mg/L, for each sites, and considering that the Fe concentration in general river water was less than 0.5 mg/L, it was confirmed that the concentration was quite high. At the JPS and JJS points, the red-water occurrence occurred mainly in stagnant places, which is believed to be strengthened by the reaction of organic and microorganisms. In the case of SBS, the wateris red, but as a result of observing the actual color, it is judged that the iron component deposited in the pipe causes an optical illusion with a deep red color. In addition, it is believed that the iron concentration can be reduced to the general river water concentration range by removing the particulate iron component through a decrease of more than 95% as a result of filtering with glass fiber filter with particulate iron. As a result of this study, it is necessary to manage the river to maintain the flow, and it is believed that the occurrence of red-water at the survey point can be alleviated through uptake action through planting and agglomeration precipitation and agglomeration filtration methods for particulate iron treatment.
