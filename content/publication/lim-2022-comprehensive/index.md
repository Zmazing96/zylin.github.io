abstract: This study shows a comprehensive study on transitioning a localized renewable energy system from various locations toward a sustainable hydrogen network by integrating with the wastewater treatment plant that generates biogas. A mixed-integer linear programming problem optimization model is developed on minimizing the total annual cost. Such a mathematical expressed model is transformed into a P-graph model, a reliable graphical optimization tool. Such an integrative network consists of four main parts, including the biogas distribution network, hydrogen production allocation, carbon dioxide utilization, and electricity usage. A petrochemical industry in South Korea that has a base demand of 7,200 tons H2/year is adopted as the case study. In return, the total annual cost (TAC) upon minimizing the model is found as 75,772,460 US $/year. An extensive scenario where the hydrogen demand is increased by 20% alongside the tight environment regulation enforced is evaluated. In which, a further sustainability enhancement approach is executed with the aid of Pareto frontier analysis and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution. As per result, the TAC and total CO2 emission are reported as 103,236,000 US$/year and 9.12 × 104 tons of CO2/year, respectively. Although the TAC increased by 72,000 US$/year from the ranked 1 P-graph solution, yet a 122 tons of CO2/year is reduced from the configuration.
