abstract: Biochar from biomass and waste is a valuable component of various urban green infrastructures, including green roofs, permeable pavements, green walls, and green parking lots. Incorporating biochar into substrate mixtures offers numerous benefits, including improved water retention, nutrient availability, plant growth, and carbon sequestration. Moreover, biochar plays a crucial role in stormwater management by effectively retaining and filtering stormwater, reducing runoff, mitigating urban flooding, and improving surface water quality. This study conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis and synthesis of the literature to provide a broad perspective of the current understanding of biochar use in green infrastructure projects, focusing on the impact of biochar on soil and environmental quality, water retention, pollutant removal and the overall performance and sustainability of green infrastructure systems. This review also provides a comprehensive synthesis of the potential of biochar in enhancing green infrastructure systems and guiding future research and implementation strategies. The insights provided in this review can guide corporate stakeholders in understanding the benefits, challenges, and applications of biochar in urban green infrastructure management, empowering them to make informed decisions and contribute to the development of sustainable and resilient urban environments aligned with the principles of the UN SDGs and ESG considerations.
