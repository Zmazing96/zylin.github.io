abstract: This study was carried out to understand the water quality characteristics of the initial stormwater runoff and the origin of soluble pollutants according to various rainfall conditions from a non-point source reducing facility. The water sample from this study was collected among 10 collection facilities in the G-drainage area. Specifically, five of the collection points including 1, 5, 8, 9, and 10 were reported with unknown water inflow even during non-rain conditions. The leakage characteristics of non-point pollutants from the collection facilities were then able to identify accordingly. The water quality characteristics of the stormwater runoff from the collection facilities were strongly affected by the amounts of rainfalls. The average concentrations of EC, BOD, TOC, and TN during non-rain were found to be higher than their concentrations during rain; on the other hand, the average concentrations of DO were found to be lower than its concentrations during rain. In addition, the distribution of organic components existing in the effluent of collection facilities were identified based on the dissolved organic matter analysis. In summary, the stormwater runoff was highly affected by pollutants flowing from the surrounding environment, and the amounts of hard-to-decompose humic substances were greatly increased in the collection facilities due to rain.
