Never the smartest mind in class but always the one not afraid of trying new things. My philosophy towards this world is all covered in one word: _BALANCE_, including my research career.

Fun-fact:
1. Enjoy playing with numbers _aka data analytics_, including AI, modeling, optimization, and blockchain. 

2. Polyglot, proficient in multiple languages. Try me!

3. Always bridge the gap between research and industry.

Thanks for spending time to understand me!
